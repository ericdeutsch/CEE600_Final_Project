resulting imagery to your Google Drive.  From there, you can manually
download the imagery to a desired location. GEE does not allow direct 
download to local storage devices.  Additionally, because imagery is 
downloaded directly to Google Drive, it cannot be retrieved use -wget.

Prior to running the code, you must also download the asset (study area
polygon, link below) using the following link.  Afterwards, import it into the code
in the Assets tab on the right side of the GUI. It will appear at the top
of the coding environment.  Rename this asset to "trimmedROI".

The comments within the code body will adequately outline the methodology used.
